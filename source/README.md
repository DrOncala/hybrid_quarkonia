The `shrodinger` folder includes **numerical methods** used to compute the **eigenvalues** and **eigenfunctions** of the Schrödinger equations including the treatment of **matrix (m×m) dimension potentials** with **non-diagonal coupling terms**.


- **`*_equations.m`**  
  Contains the Schrödinger equations that describe each state, including the definition of the **matrix potentials** required for each configuration.  
  These functions are called by the main files.

- **`potential.m`**  
  Defines the **static potentials** used in the calculations.
