# Decay Tables

This folder contains the **Excel tables** and a **PDF printout** summarizing the hybrid-to-quarkonium decay results.

---

## File Contents

- The **first sheet** of the Excel file provides the **exact definitions of all columns** used throughout the tables.  
- The **first three pages** of the PDF correspond to the **expanded transition tables (green)**:
  1. **Spin-conserved transitions**
  2. **Spin-flip transitions** starting from **spin 0**
  3. **Spin-flip transitions** starting from **spin 1**

## Column Notes

- The **last columns** show the **error components** as estimated in **Equations (53)** and **(54)** of the reference.  
- **Red values** correspond to cases with **errors greater than 100%**.  
- **Black values** are those **included in the draft**.  
- **Blue values** are those **added to the identification table** in the draft.

## Additional Pages

The subsequent pages list **all decay channels allowed by the selection rules**.

- Columns are provided showing how each **constraint** is evaluated.  
- **Red rows** indicate cases that are **discarded** for one reason or another.  
- **Green rows** correspond to **channels that satisfy all constraints** and are therefore **kept** in the analysis.

## VBA Functions

The **last sheet** of the Excel file contains the **VBA functions** used to perform some calculations.

Occasionally, these functions may be **deleted or lost** from the VBA module.  
If that happens, they can simply be **copied and pasted** again into a **new VBA module** within the Excel file.

**Summary:**  
This directory contains the structured, color-coded, and verified results of the hybrid-to-quarkonium decay calculations, formatted both as **Excel spreadsheets** (for analysis) and **PDF summaries** (for documentation).
